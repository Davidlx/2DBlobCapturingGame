// To Test a js class or a js function, you can use the provided functions in this framework
// However, this framework can only run at Node.js Command Line Tool Enviornment
// Also, you need to use "npm install unit.js" to set the enviornment for testing
var test = require('unit.js');


// To test a function, you need to be able to refer to that function
// You can either copy and paste it here, or you can include that file which is recommonded

// During the testing process, you need to write as many testing cases as you can untill you can not find more.
// For each testing case, you need to use the function as below to assert it (which is a way to test it). More APIs are provided here: http://unitjs.com/guide/quickstart.html
// test.assert(typeof 'foobar' == 'int');


// Ideally, you need to test at least 5 cases against each functions. And you need to provide commonts for each test case.
